        <h2> What is Orange FM? </h2>
        Orange FM is a modern cartridge for the Game Boy family of handhelds. You can think of it as a car stereo system in a cartridge, featuring digital tuning, presets, basic radio text support, and other fun features!

        <br/><br/>
        Fully populated and soldered boards are available for purchase - you only need to trim a cartridge shell to fit. A DIY version (you buy/solder 90% of the parts) is also available!

        <h2> FAQ </h2>

        <h3>How does the speaker output work?</h3>
        <p>All Game Boy models until the GBA have an audio input capability on the cartridge connector. This makes it fairly easy to send mono audio into the Game Boy, where it is mixed with the internal sound hardware. The input volume depends on the model, with the Game Boy Color performing the best. 

          <br/><br/>This feature was never officially (to my knowledge) used by Nintendo, although some other projects like the <a href="https://nanoloop.com/mono/index.html">Nanoloop Mono</a> make use of it.
        <p>

        <h3>How hard would assembling my own cart be?</h3>
        <p>If you purchase an assembled PCB, <a href="shell_cutting_guide.html">all you need to do is cut a cartridge shell to fit</a>. No soldering is required! </p>
        <p>Building your own DIY Orange FM cart from scratch requires experience with fine-pitch SMD soldering. Additionally, there is one QFN package chip you'll need to solder with hot air, hot plate, etc. So this is not a soldering project for beginners!
        </p>

        <h3>What is the situation with the antenna / reception?</h3>
        <p>
          Orange FM supports both a built-in antenna (which requires nothing to be attached to the cart), as well as an external antenna connected to the cart's 3.5mm antenna/headphone jack.
          <br/><br/>
          The built-in antenna offers fairly weak, but often usable reception. The station strength may be a bit positional, and you're likely to only receive the strongest local stations. This is great if you just want to casually blast some tunes from the Game Boy speaker, as you don't need to attach anything extra to the cart.
          <br/><br/>
          To improve the reception, you can attach an external antenna to the cart through the 3.5mm antenna/headphone jack. This can be a pair of headphones, a telescopic antenna, a 3.5mm aux cord, or a purpose-made antenna cord. It's easy to make your own antennas, so you can experiment if you like! The external antenna interface will offer stronger, more reliable reception, depending on the length of your antenna. The best performing antenna is typically a 1 meter long cable, about the same length as the average headphone cord.
        </p>

        <h3>Will Orange FM work in my country?</h3>
        <p>Probably. Orange FM supports 87.5 - 108 MHz for most of the world, and 76 - 95 MHz for Japan. There is also a full range mode that will give you 64 - 108 Mhz. You can choose between 200 kHz (e.g. 88.5, 88.7, 88.9, etc) and 100 kHz (e.g. 88.5, 88.6, 88.7, etc) spacing options. You can also select the de-emphasis (50us or 75us) which varies depending on where in the world you are.
        <br/><br/>
        Italy may use 50 kHz spacing (e.g. 88.75) for some stations - unfortunately Orange FM can't tune to these stations at present.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you support AM / DAB / HD Radio / Weather?</h3>
        <p>Not happening for Orange FM, as I've already committed to the current radio chip I'm using.</p>

        <h3>Could you make a GBA-sized version?</h3>
        <p>In a standard GBA-cart shell - no. Similar to Boktai or other "larger" GBA games - maybe. But don't expect one!</p>

          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004G7O1PI"> 3ft aux cable </a>: Best reception typically. This is a thin one I like, but you can use any aux cable. 3ft to one meter is an ideal size. You can use a shorter one if you want, it'll just lower the reception a bit.</li>
          <li>Most pairs of wired headphones should make a very good antenna. </li>
